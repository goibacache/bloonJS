# bloonJS
A Discord Bot replacement for our fallen comrade.
Uses DiscordJS to handle the discord interactions and events.

In order to run and install locally you'll need to make a copy of config.js.example and rename it config.js suplying your own data into that file. It should work from that point onwards.
